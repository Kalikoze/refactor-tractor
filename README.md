# Refactor Tractor
This was our third project (team of three) from Mod2 (of 4 mods total) at Turing School of Software and Design. We were give a week and a half to refactor an existing code base, DRY up the code and implement incomplete features. The app uses `fetch()` method to `GET` data from an API. A major learning goal for this project was to create a robust testing suite using Chai, Chai Spies, and Mocha to thouroughly test units.

## Project Learning Goals
* Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone elseâ€™s codebase
* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the * * code is accurate and that everyone understands it
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
* Detect cross-browser compatibility issues by testing your app on different platforms and environments
* Practice (or solidify) your understanding of DOM manipulation with jQuery
* Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process
* Leverage Chai Spies to verify that your DOM manipulation is happening

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS/SASS
* JavaScript
* JQUERY
* MOCHA/CHAI
* CHAI SPIES
* NPM
* WEBPACK

## Directions for Use
* On app load 1 of 50 ranodom users will be logged with their individual pantry information of ingredients.
